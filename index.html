        <h1>Anime</h1>
        <p>I like watching anime on tv in my tv time. Some of the animes that I am currently watching are My Hero Academia which is about a boy named Izuku Midoriya who is quirkless but still looks upon at his hero All Might and gets a chance to wield All Might's quirk One For All and become his succesor. Another one is One Punch Man which is about an ordinary man named saitama. Saitama trains hard for more than an year and gains immense power with which he can destroy a monster in one punch. There are also others like Naruto, and Dragon Ball Z.</p>
